# Applying for a job (in Europe)
When I was leaving EPFL, I had the big task of applying for a job in Europe as an American citizen without a work or residence permit. I had really be on my game. Needless to say, it was frustrating experience. Some places wouldn't even consider me because of the legal requirements associated with hiring a non-EU citizen.

Starting in June, I submitted my CV and cover letter to over 75 jobs (30 in Switzerland, the rest through Europe) in the span of a couple months. Of these, I probably received just a couple dozen follows-up (e.g. clarifying my experience). These led to interviews or invitations to interview at:

Akanoo
Booking.com
CrowdyNews
Education4Sight
GetYourGuide
Trivago
Spotify
SwissQuote

(*There were a few more invitations to interview, including at Apple, but these came long after I accepted a job offer in September.*)

Still, I learned a few things which I will share with you.

But first, if I had to summarize, the most important thing is for you **make it easier for companies to hire you**! 

(*The other trick is to create several templates of your CV and cover letter for different areas or types of jobs. In my experience, this strikes a good balance between efficiency and effectiveness.*)

# The cover letter
Here is an example of a cover letter for the Netherlands eScience Research center, which I created using LaTeX: [Cover letter, June 2014](../assets/vma_cover.pdf)

I believe that while some companies don't care for a cover letter, a *well-written* and somehwat *tailored* cover letter never hurts. And it may in fact help you by demonstrating your interest and professionalism.

My cover letters consist of these components:

1. Introduction
2. Motivation
3. Qualifications
4. Potential
5. Closing

With my cover letter as an example, let me demonstrate what I mean.

## Introduction

> **The Netherlands eScience Center**
> Re: **eScience Research Engineer**
> September 18, 2014
> 
> Dear Sir or Madam,
> Please accept my curriculum vitae and cover letter as part of my formal application for the available **eScience Research Engineer** position at **The Netherlands eScience Center**.

What's important here is to be brief, direct, and polite. Cite the job and the company for which you're applying. Clearly state that you're applying for the job. (Some people will debate me on the last one)

## Motivation

> After some time in engineering and in academia, I am seeking a strong start to a career which uses **data science**, including the **analysis** and **management of data**. This available position offers me the practical and technical work with which I will have the most success and pleasure,and I hope that it will have many growth opportunities as well. Given my diverse experience, technical skills, and ability to learn quickly, I am confident I can succeed at The Netherlands eScience Center.

Your future employer should know *WHY* you're applying for *THIS* job. My work interests are in **bold** and derived from the content in the job posting. You should carefully select these key phrases from any job posting you applying for. This makes it easier for human resources and hiring managers to recognize that your interests match theirs.

There's also generic, but true, statements about growth opportunities and thinking that the company and job are a good fit for me.

## Qualifications

> As noted in my CV and LinkedIn profile, I completed a year of Ph.D studies and research in computer science, and I hold a Master’s degree in systems engineering, focused on analyzing and modeling complex systems. Thus, I have a solid quantitative and problem-oriented academic background. I also have real-world experience, earned through internships and several years as a professional systems engineer and analyst. Over the past few years, I have become proficient and experienced in various areas of data science, including: machine learning, probability, statistical programming (Matlab, Python, R), and database software such as MySQL and MongoDB. I have applied these skills in the areas of large-scale text analysis, radar performance, social networks, and more.

In part 1 of my qualifications, I discuss technical or "hard" skills. This includes my educational background, work experience (professional and pre-professional), theoretical knowledge, and computer skills (e.g. Python, MySQL). I also cite several application domains. 

Finally, you may have noted that I mention my CV and LinkedIn profile right away. By referring to my CV, I explicitly tie this cover letter and what I'm saying to the content of the CV. If I say that I've worked in large-scale text analysis, the employer will expect to see evidence of that in my CV. By referring to my LinkedIn profile, I'm accomplishing the same thing with two extra benefits:

- It looks very professional to have a *well-maintained* online presence, especially as more and more companies use LinkedIn for vetting applicants and search for jobs. You never know, a company my reach out to you because of your LinkedIn profile alone!

- You have pretty much unlimited space for all your experience, projects, qualifications, etc. Of course, you still need to be organized, but this is a freebie. Naturally, you need to be concise in your CV. (Who has time to carefully inspect 100s of these?) But say someone is interested. Then, they can immediately go on the internet and find out more information which can been carefully crafted by you to give them the best possible impression.


> Over my career, I have enjoyed working in innovative, multi-cultural environments, and developed the communication skills necessary for work in cross-functional teams, which will serve me as I interact with other employees. At the same time, I’m able to act independently and pro-actively, taking ownership of my work. Regardless of the task, I choose to be pragmatic and results-oriented.

In part 2 of my qualifications, I emphasize my "soft skills". These are things like communication skill, social skills, pro-activity, organization, etc. This is often overlooked, and also hard to prove, but very important. Unless you're doing silo research in an ivory tower (and perhaps even still!), you need to work well with other people. You need to be adaptable to different kinds of work environments. And you need to have the right mentality ot get things done.

## Potential

> I am highly motivated to succeed, especially if I can learn something new. I consider myself a quick and adaptive learner, and I am excited to learn more about eScience, ICT, and your company.

I have to admit that I forget where I read this, but there was a survey that said that one of the things that hiring managers cared most about was whether the applicant had *potential* to grow in the company. Are they going to just do the job as described in the posting? Or will they succeed, take on more responsibility, and deliver more value to the company?

In other words, you want to be seen as an *investment*.

Now, I don't do a great job about it here, besides saying that I am motivated, a quick learner, and most importantly *interested* in the company. I've heard of many cases where an otherwise qualified candidate was not hired because he or she didn't seem genuinely interested in the company or its work, or because they didn't seem like the kind of person who stay for the long-term.

To improve this section, I would suggest that you cite specific cases of growth in past experiences, whether at work or in school. Even better, be proactive and start doing something related to the job right now! For example, I could take a look at some of the research areas of the eScience center and start reading papers, even if superficially. And then put that in my cover letter. =P

## Closing
> I am available to start as soon as possible. Please let me know if you would like any additional information. I would be glad to provide it. My contact information is at the head of this cover letter as well as my curriculum vitae.
> 
> Thank you for your consideration. I am looking forward to your positive reply.
> Sincerely yours,
> Victor Ma

Finally, finish by telling them your availability to start and your readiness to provide further information. In case they haven't noticed it, refer to the location of your contact information (it *is* in your application documents, right?) so that it's easy for them to reply to you. 

Thank the reader, and be clear that you're looking forward to a *positive* reply. Confidence helps.

# Other details
This post is mostly about the cover letter, but there are some other things I've learned as well.

## Searching for jobs
Some companies prefer, and sometimes only consider, applicants who apply on their own websites. The problem is that there are way too many relevant companies for you to do this. Of course, if it's a well-known company or one that you are really passionate about, go for it. There shouldn't be that many of these on your list anyway.

My recommendation is to use a meta-job search site, such as [Indeed](www.indeed.com). The nice thing about Indeed is that you can search for jobs in each country by just going to the applicable internationalized site, such as [www.indeed.ch](www.indeed.ch) (Switzerland), [de.indeed.com](de.indeed.com) (Germany), and [se.indeed.com](se.indeed.com) (Sweden). 

Another nice feature is that the site can remember your past queries and, when you visit the site again (I checked weekly), it will tell you how many new job postings match those queries. This will save you a lot of time.

## Curriculum Vitae
Here is my CV for the same job application: [Curriculum Vitae, June 2014](../assets/vma_cv.pdf)

I think the CV might require a bit more work to describe, but let me summarize my advice:

- Use a clean, beautiful template.
- Keep it short! 1 page max, or a little over if you have *a few* non-essential things that can be cut off.
- Understand the targe country's customs. For example, in the Netherlands, they (apparently) really like it if you put your age/birth date, and describe some hobbies and interests.
- Put a link to any portfolio or online presence (e.g. LinkedIn) that you have.
- *Concisely* describe what you did at school or at previous jobs. If possible, point to specific and/or quantifiable achievements.

Finally, **don't be afraid to change your "job title"**! For example, if your "official" job title was "student intern", I think it's perfectly acceptable to change it to something more meaningful and relevant, say, "machine learning researcher" or "engineering trainee". Pick something that better frames your responsibilities and skills, i.e. what you *DID*, not what you *ARE*. In my later CVs, I changed from working at The MITRE Corporation as a "Senior Sensor Systems Engineer" (quite a mouthful) to the more succint and less confusing "Senior Engineer". 

## What if I don't have all the skills cited in the job posting?

I definitely don't recommend lying about it. But here's what I do suggest:

Start learning those skills *NOW*! I didn't know MongoDB, so I installed it on my computer, and spent a couple hours doing tutorials and familiarizing myself with it, thinking about how I might use it in the future.

You don't have to be an expert. Nor should you expect to be. But the difference is that now you can honestly claim experience/skills and begin to talk intelligently about this skill if you're asked. Which is way better than having nothing, or worse, lying. Besides, in the happy event you get called for an interview, then you can start improving that skill or any other potential weakness you might have.

You could even spin it this way: You admit that you didn't have the skill before you saw the job posting, but you were so motivated, now you do! You can *currently* do X, Y, and Z with it. And in the *future*, you expect to be able to do A, B, and C as well!
